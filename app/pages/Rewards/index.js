      'The most important aspect of a Medical Quality Review is detailing accurate medical information that will help other individuals – as well as producers and doctors – better understand how this strain will help them with their medical issue. For example, if you’re using cannabis to treat anxiety, let us know if it helped, how it helped, and if there were any side-effects that added to or detracted from the treatment.',
      'Your review should also offer information on your experience as a customer.

Was the shipping time and cost acceptable? Would you recommend this Licensed Producer to other people?',
